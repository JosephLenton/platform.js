platform.js
===========

Right now, this is just a dump of the bits I've been working on so far,
and isn't a real project to be used.

This is an experiment in building a GUI framework,
for building complex and sophisticated JavaScript applications.

It features it's own DOM and CSS manipulation libraries,
as well as utility functions, and it's own JavaScript-like language.
